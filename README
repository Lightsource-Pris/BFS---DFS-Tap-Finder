TO RUN THE CODE

Open BFSAgent.ipynb and run the cells to observe the implementation using BFS Algorithm
open DFSAgent.ipynb and run the cells for DFS Algorithm

The 'Experiments & Results' folder contains animations of results of all experiments (some results were removed because of their large size). It also contains the environment tree-like graphical overview.

In Experiments & Results -> graph.html , blue represents taps with no water sources, green for taps with water sources and red for inaccessible nodes.

environment.py contains configurations for 25nodes while declaring and defining required environmental variables, functions and objects.

environment2.py is similar but contains configuration for bigger contexts - 50 nodes.

GraphTree.ipynb is the code used to display the graphical tree-like overview, it can be run cell by cell for another view

The image files were used in setting up the environment.
